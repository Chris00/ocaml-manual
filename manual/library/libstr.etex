The "str" library provides high-level string processing functions,
some based on regular expressions. It is intended to support the kind
of file processing that is usually performed with scripting languages
such as "awk", "perl" or "sed".

Programs that use the "str" library must be linked in ``custom
runtime'' mode, as follows:
\begin{alltt}
        ocamlc -custom \var{other options} str.cma \var{other files} -cclib -lstr
        ocamlopt \var{other options} str.cmxa \var{other files} -cclib -lstr
\end{alltt}
For interactive use of the "str" library, do:
\begin{alltt}
        ocamlmktop -custom -o mytop str.cma -cclib -lstr
        ./mytop
\end{alltt}

\begin{library}
\input str.tex
\end{library}
